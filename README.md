# Portfolio
This is my developer protfolio, will update in order to update the projects I am working on.

**Getting Started**
Just click around I will start adding easter eggs.

**Instaling**
Follow the links to the webpage

**Built With**
HTML
CSS

**Acknowledgments**
I recieve assistance from my tutor Corey Yates. 
When confused on a solution I bounced between asking AskBCS and GitHub CoPilot and then looking in stack overflow and compiled what solution I felt worked best.

I used the AskBCS how I could properly align items in the header and space li in class=link-space
